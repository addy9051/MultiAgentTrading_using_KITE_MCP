# Multi-Agent Algorithmic Trading System MVP

A sophisticated multi-agent trading system built with LangChain and LangGraph, integrating with Kite Connect 3 API through MCP server for secure market data access and trading signal generation.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This system implements a multi-agent framework inspired by the TauricResearch/TradingAgents repository, featuring:

### Core Agents
- **Market Data Agent**: Fetches live/historical market data via Kite MCP server
- **Technical Analysis Agent**: Calculates technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- **Signal Generation Agent**: Generates trading signals using LLM-powered analysis
- **Risk Assessment Agent**: Evaluates position sizing and risk management

### Workflow Orchestration
- **LangGraph StateGraph**: Coordinates agent interactions and data flow
- **Sequential Processing**: Market Data ‚Üí Technical Analysis ‚Üí Signal Generation ‚Üí Risk Assessment ‚Üí Execution
- **Shared State**: All agents work with a common TradingState for seamless data sharing
