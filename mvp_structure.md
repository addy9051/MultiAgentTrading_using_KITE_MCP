# Enhanced Multi-Agent Algorithmic Trading System

## Overview

This is a sophisticated 7-agent algorithmic trading system based on the TauricResearch/TradingAgents architecture. The system integrates with Kite Connect 3 API through an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and uses LangChain and LangGraph frameworks to orchestrate multiple specialized agents that work together to analyze market data, generate trading signals, and manage risk through a structured 5-stage workflow.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Enhanced System Architecture

### Core Framework
- **TauricResearch/TradingAgents Architecture**: Based on the award-winning research framework achieving 30.5% annualized returns
- **LangChain & LangGraph**: Individual agent implementation and multi-agent workflow orchestration
- **7-Agent System**: Specialized agents with distinct roles and expertise areas
- **5-Stage Workflow**: Sequential and parallel processing for optimal efficiency
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses Python's asyncio for handling concurrent operations and API calls

### Enhanced Agent Architecture
The system implements a sophisticated 5-stage workflow with 7 specialized agents:

#### Stage I: Analyst Team (5 agents in parallel)
1. **Market Data Agent** → fetches live and historical market data
2. **Technical Analysis Agent** → calculates technical indicators and patterns
3. **Fundamentals Analyst** → evaluates company financials and metrics
4. **Sentiment Analyst** → analyzes market sentiment from news and social media
5. **News Analyst** → monitors and analyzes news events and market catalysts

#### Stage II: Research Team (2 agents in parallel)
6. **Bull Researcher** → advocates for bullish positions and identifies opportunities
7. **Bear Researcher** → advocates for bearish positions and identifies risks

#### Stage III: Signal Generation
- **Signal Generation Agent** → generates trading signals using comprehensive analysis

#### Stage IV: Risk Management
- **Risk Assessment Agent** → evaluates position sizing and risk management

#### Stage V: Portfolio Management
- **Portfolio Manager** → makes final trading decisions based on all analysis

### State Management
- **Shared State**: All agents work with a common `TradingState` TypedDict for seamless data sharing
- **Message Passing**: Agents communicate through structured state updates
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error tracking and handling across the workflow

## Key Components

### Market Data Integration

- **Configurable Parameters**: RSI periods, overbought/oversold thresholds
- **Numpy Integration**: Efficient numerical calculations for indicators

### Trading Signal Generation
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Combines multiple technical indicators
- **LLM-powered Analysis**: Uses GPT-4o for pattern recognition and sentiment analysis
- **Confidence Scoring**: Signals include strength assessment and confidence levels

### Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: Calculates optimal position size based on account balance and risk tolerance
- **Stop Loss/Take Profit**: Automatic calculation of risk management levels
- **Volatility Assessment**: Market volatility consideration in risk calculations

### Web Interface
- **Flask Application**: Simple web interface for monitoring system status
- **Real-time Updates**: API endpoints for system status and trading results
- **Dashboard**: Basic visualization of trading system state

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: System loads configuration and initializes MCP client connection
2. **Market Data Collection**: Fetches live quotes and historical data for target symbol
3. **Technical Analysis**: Calculates various technical indicators from historical data
4. **Signal Generation**: Combines technical indicators with LLM analysis to generate trading signals
5. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates position sizing and risk management parameters
6. **Order Simulation**: Logs potential orders (simulation mode enabled by default)

## External Dependencies
